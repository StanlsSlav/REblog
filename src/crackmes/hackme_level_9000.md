## Solution
This crackme is nice in its own way. No difficulties, just more instructions that one might be used to (me) and spelunky fake variables.

Recon should always be done, however this crackme doesn't require it. The part that must be found is the instruction that compares your current level to max level and change it to check for greater instead of less or equal, don't forget the second check too. But by doing this you will need to calculate the first operation, so why not just jump directly into the flag part and get it asap.
