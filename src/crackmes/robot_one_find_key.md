## Solution
Checking down on the last jump op weâ€™ll find, with a debugger, that the value from `[rbp+var_A0]` is exactly our user input and in `eax` is stored the hexadecimal value of an ASCII character.

```assembly
cmp     [rbp+var_A0], eax ; Compare Two Operands
jnz     short loc_55AA77091808 ; Jump if Not Zero (ZF=0)
```

Adjusting the key to match all those 4 characters results in the correct key.

## Answer
`0b2d`
